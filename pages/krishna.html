<p>Krishna, the all-attractive-one is arguably the most popular God of the sub-continent! He is Megh-varna, the color-of-clouds; Go-pal, the protector of cows; Murli-manohar, who steals hearts by the melody of his flute; and Madan-Mohan who can mesmerize Cupid himself with His beauty..Murli-Manohar Krishna
However, this post is not about Krishna, the God. Enough has been said and written in almuper-human personality. I kinda wanted to explore the historical origin of His enigmatic life and hence will try to steer clear of 'FAITH' and focus more on the 'FACTS'.
Historical period of Krishna Shrimad Bhagvatam declares that Krishna arrives on Earth towards the end of the Dwapar Yug of the 7th Manvantar of the 1st Kalpa of the 51st year of the current Brahma.. rather precise timing there!!
For those who do not understand these terms let me enlighten you a little: Each Brahma lives a lifetime of 100 years; each year with 360 days called Kalpas; each day divided into 14 Manvantars; and each Manvantar divided into 71 Maha-Yugas with 4 Yugas each. {For details on the Hindu calculation of time, check this link - Kaalchakra, the Hindu Timeline}.
Currently, we are in the last of the four Yugas called the Kaliyuga which, according to astronomical calculations, began on the 20th of February 3102 BCE. Now, this would place Krishna roughly around 3300-3200 BCE as the Bhagvatam states that Kaliyuga couldn't begin till Krishna was on the planet! 
Fortunately, there is a large body of literary and archaeological evidence that can guide us towards an approximate time-period for His presence. The earliest text to explicitly provide detailed descriptions of Krishna is of course the epic Mahabharat.
