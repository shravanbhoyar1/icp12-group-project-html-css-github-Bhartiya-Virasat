<p>Jagannatha, form under which the Hindu god Krishna is worshipped at Puri, Odisha (Orissa), and at Ballabhpur, a suburb of Shrirampur, West Bengal state, India. The 12th-century temple of Jagannatha in Puri towers above the town. In its sanctuary, wooden images represent Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra (Balarama), and his sister Subhadra. Modern representations made in Puri of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of Vishnu often show Jagannatha as one of the 10 in place of the more usually accepted Buddha.The Chariot Festival of the Jagannatha temple, Puri, Orissa, India.The Chariot Festival of the Jagannatha temple, Puri, Orissa, India.
The most important of the numerous yearly festivals is the Chariot Festival (Rathayatra), which takes place on the second day of the bright fortnight of Ashadha (Juneâ€“July). The image is placed in a wagon so heavy that the efforts of hundreds of devotees are required to move it, and it is dragged through deep sand to the country house of the god. The journey takes several days, and thousands of pilgrims participate. Reports of these processions in the past have been much exaggerated, although accidents are common and occasionally a frenzied pilgrim attempts to throw himself under the wagon. The English word juggernaut, with its connotation of a force crushing whatever is in its path, is derived from this festival.
